# JavaScript-Virtualizer


The project being discussed is a JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSVM). This tool is designed to interpret and execute JavaScript code, bridging the gap between the abstract world of JavaScript and the tangible world of physical computer hardware.

The JSVM operates by reading and parsing JavaScript scripts, compiling them into machine code, and then executing that code. Throughout this process, the JSVM applies optimizations at each step to enhance performance.

Different JavaScript engines, often referred to as codenames, exist for various browsers. For instance, Google's V8 engine powers Chrome, Opera, and Edge, while Firefox uses SpiderMonkey. Each of these engines has its own version of the JSVM, allowing JavaScript code to execute in a platform-independent environment.
